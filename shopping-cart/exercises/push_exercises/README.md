# Understanding `push()` in JavaScript

## ðŸ“Œ What is `push()`?

The `push()` method in JavaScript is used to **add elements to the end of an array**.

### ðŸ§  Think of an array like a row of boxes.

When you use `push()`, you're putting a new item **in the next empty box** at the end.

```js
let fruits = [];
fruits.push("Apple"); // ["Apple"]
fruits.push("Banana"); // ["Apple", "Banana"]
fruits.push("Mango", "Kiwi"); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Kiwi"]
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Facts:

- `push()` can add **one or more items** at a time.
- It returns the **new length** of the array.
- It **modifies** the original array.

## ðŸ§ª Why Learn `push()`?

You will use `push()` any time you want to **collect data**, such as:

- Adding items to a shopping cart.
- Storing user input.
- Tracking values over time in a loop.
- Building arrays dynamically from conditions.
