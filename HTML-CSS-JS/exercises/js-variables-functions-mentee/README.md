# JavaScript Practice: Variables, Functions, and Data Types (Beginner Edition)

This exercise pack is designed to help **absolute beginners** understand how JavaScript works step by step.

---

## 🔍 What You Will Learn

### 🧠 VARIABLES

You will learn how to store information in a **variable**, which is like giving a label to a value so you can reuse it later.

- Use `const` when the value should not change
- Use `let` when the value might change later
- Example: `const myName = "Sam";`

### 🧠 DATA TYPES

JavaScript can store different kinds of information called **data types**. You'll practice the most common ones:

- **String** → Text, like `"Hello"`
- **Number** → Numbers, like `42`
- **Boolean** → `true` or `false`
- **Null** → An empty value on purpose
- **Undefined** → A variable declared but not yet assigned
- **Array** → A list of values, like `["red", "blue", "green"]`
- **Object** → A collection of key-value pairs, like `{ name: "Sam", age: 25 }`

### 🧠 FUNCTIONS

Functions are reusable blocks of code that do something when called.
You’ll learn how to:

- Declare a function using `function myFunc() {}`
- Use `return` to send a result back
- Pass in values using **parameters**
- Example: `function greet(name) { return "Hello " + name; }`
