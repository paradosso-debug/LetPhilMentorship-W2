# Shopping Cart Project

## üß† What You're Learning

This project helps you understand:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Adding and removing HTML elements dynamically
- **Event Handling**: Using button clicks to trigger functions
- **Arrays and Objects**: Storing multiple products in a list
- **Input Handling**: Getting and validating data from input fields
- **Code Structure**: Breaking logic into reusable functions

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Adding Products**:
   - The user types a name and price and clicks "Add Product".
   - The app stores it in the `cart` array and updates the UI.

2. **Removing Products**:
   - Each product gets a "Remove" button.
   - Clicking it removes that item from the `cart`.

3. **Calculating Total**:
   - Each time the cart changes, the total is recalculated and displayed.

This is a great beginner exercise for understanding how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and user inputs.
